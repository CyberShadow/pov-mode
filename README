INSTALLATION

To automatically load pov-mode every time Emacs starts up, put the
following line into your .emacs file:

     (require 'pov-mode)

or better: 

        (autoload 'pov-mode "pov-mode"
           "PoVray scene file mode" t)
        (setq auto-mode-alist
	      (append '(("\\.pov\\'" . pov-mode) 
		        ("\\.inc\\'" . pov-mode))
               auto-mode-alist))

The file pov-mode.el and the InsertMenu gerarchy *MUST* be in your
load-path. (Use C-h v load-path to see which directories are in the
load-path).
This package contains 2 icons and over 200 example
scenes, so I'd suggest you to add the whole content of the tarball
to the load-path in your .emacs. Example:

   (setq load-path (cons "/path/to/pov-mode/pov-mode-mp-2.20/"
                 load-path))

Once you have add the content of the tarball to the load path, and
modified your .emacs, you can restart emacs. Try to open a new file
named test.pov. pov-mode should start automagically. There's
another step you must to do: adding the path to the povray'
documentation.

Adding the path to the documentation is very simple: once the pov-mode has
been loaded, go to the customize menu, typing 

   M-x customize-group RET pov RET

you *must* set these two variables:

Pov Include Dir
Pov Documentation Directory

The default is the default installation path of the official povray
binary distribution as root. You may have installed povray
somewhere else, so fix it! Usually you should change only the
prefix /usr/local to your installation PREFIX
After this step you *must* push the botton "Save for Future
Sessions" and restart emacs. That's all!


NOTE: To achieve any sort of reasonable performance, you should
  byte-compile this package.  In emacs, type M-x byte-compile-file
  and then enter the name of this file.

You can customize the behaviour of pov-mode and via the
customization menu or by simply entering M-x customize-group pov.
So, try this! 

You can customize the Insert menu simply by adding the target 
file in the directory InsertMenu. Please rename the file with the
syntax NUMBER NUMBER SPACE - SPACE NAME WITH SPACES.txt
e.g. "01 - My template.txt". If you use the shell write:
mv myfile.pov 01\ -\ My\ template.txt
Then move it in the InserMenu directory: choose the appropriate 
subdirectory. The number indicate the menu order. Done! Just
restart emacs.

To learn about the basics, just load a pov-file and press C-h m.
