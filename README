Please run first the setup.sh, which will ask you where can find the
POV-Ray files and where your lisp files reside, then modify your
.emacs following the instruction in the comments in
"pov-mode.el" or in the output of this script

If you are a Winzoz user, and you can't exec the setup.sh script, you
*must* edit pov-mode.el manually. So, change all the occurrences of 
SHARELIBSPOVRAY    	with the directory where platform-independent
			     files of POV-Ray resides.
EMACSLISPLIBRARY	with the directory where you unpack this package
POVRAYHTMLDOCDIR	with the directory where resides the HTML
			     documentation of POV-Ray.

Then add this lines to your .emacs configuration file:

(autoload 'pov-mode "\path\to\pov-mode" ; PLEASE EDIT THIS
  "PoVray scene file mode" t)
(setq auto-mode-alist
	(append '(("\\.pov$" . pov-mode) 
		  ("\\.inc$" . pov-mode)
                ) auto-mode-alist))

Finally, fix the name of the keyword index file via M-x
customize-group pov.
Let me know if it works.
